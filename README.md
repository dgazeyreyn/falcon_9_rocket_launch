# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction üöÄ

**Predicted the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings** using real mission data ‚Äî with the goal of estimating potential launch costs and helping competitors evaluate bids against SpaceX.  

**Key highlights:**  
- üì• **Data collection & wrangling** from SpaceX API, Wikipedia, and web scraping.  
- üîç **Exploratory data analysis** to uncover mission, payload, and launch site patterns.  
- üìä **Visualization** of trends, correlations, and geographic launch locations.  
- ü§ñ **Predictive modeling** using classification algorithms to forecast landing success.  
- üìÑ Final **capstone report** summarizing findings and business implications.

## Overview
SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rockets cost about **$62M** per launch ‚Äî far less than the ~$165M charged by many competitors. A major reason: SpaceX reuses its **first stage** after successful landings.  

In this project, we use real mission data to **predict whether the first stage will land successfully**.  
If a competitor could forecast this with reasonable accuracy, they could better estimate launch costs and bid competitively.

## Objectives
- Develop Python code to manipulate data in Pandas.  
- Convert JSON data into Pandas DataFrames.  
- Apply data science methodology to define and solve a real-world business problem.  
- Load, clean, and explore datasets to extract meaningful insights.  
- Create sharable Jupyter Notebooks hosted on GitHub.
